# 07 Token-Swap-Smart-Contract

---

The contract below demonstrate a swap of two tokens between two parties at the same time (atomic).

- Alice owns token 1
- Bob owns token 2

The function in contract below will execute successfully only if it can swap both tokens at the same exact time
Think about the future possibilities of this type of exchange. This contract eliminates the need of trust between two parties.

Can we make it broad to allow anyone to make pair with anyone person but restricted to one person per pair?
Can we make it allow a broad range of ERC20 tokens?

Open and find out ðŸ˜‰.
